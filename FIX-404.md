# 🔧 FIXING THE 404 ERROR

## The Problem

You're getting: `Error: Ollama returned 404: Not Found`

This means **the model name is wrong** or **the model isn't installed**.

---

## 🎯 QUICK FIX (3 steps)

### Step 1: Check What Models You Have

Run this in terminal:
```bash
ollama list
```

You'll see something like:
```
NAME                    ID              SIZE
llama2:latest          abc123...       3.8 GB
mistral:latest         def456...       4.1 GB
```

### Step 2: Find the Exact Model Name

Look for anything with "kimi" in the name. The **exact name matters**.

❌ Wrong: `kimi-k2.5-cloud`  
✅ Right: `kimi-k2.5-cloud:latest` (if that's what `ollama list` shows)

### Step 3: Update Your App

Two options:

**Option A: Pull the kimi model**
```bash
ollama pull kimi-k2.5-cloud
```

**Option B: Use a different model**
1. Open the chat app
2. Click ⚙️ Settings
3. Change "Model Name" to one from your `ollama list`
4. Click "Save Settings"
5. Try chatting again

## 🔍 Still Not Working?

Run the diagnostic script:
```bash
./diagnose.sh
```

This will tell you exactly what's wrong.

## 📋 Common Issues

### "Model not found" in ollama list
The kimi model isn't installed.

**Fix:**
```bash
ollama pull kimi-k2.5-cloud
```

If that doesn't work, the model might have a different name. Try:
```bash
ollama search kimi
```

### Model name has extra stuff
Sometimes models have tags like `:latest` or `:7b`

**Example:** If `ollama list` shows `kimi-k2.5-cloud:latest`, use that EXACT name in settings.

### Proxy issues
Make sure:
- Proxy is running (`node proxy.js`)
- Settings URL is `http://localhost:8080` (not 11434)

---

## ✅ The Solution That Works Every Time

1. Run: `ollama list`
2. Copy the EXACT name of any model
3. Paste it into Settings → Model Name
4. Save and try again

**It will work.**

## 🆘 Emergency Fallback

If nothing works, try this guaranteed-to-work model:

```bash
ollama pull llama2
```

Then in app settings, set model to: `llama2`

This model is small, fast, and works everywhere.
